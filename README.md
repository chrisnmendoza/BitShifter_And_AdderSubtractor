Contains VHDL code for CPEG324 - Lab 2
The objective of this lab was to develop a Shift register in VHDL, as well as an adder/subtractor. 
The shift register is clock-dependent, and thus utilizes synchronous circuitry, while the adder/subtractor is asynchronous, with the only
delays being that of delta delays in the simulation cycle.
The register and adder/subtractor testbench can be executed through the make commands in the Makefiles.
Note, requires ghdl.
